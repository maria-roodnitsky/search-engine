This is a fun little search engine built entirely in C. 

It crawls the web using the crawler, indexes pages using the indexer, and accepts search queries using the querier. 

It isn't Google, but it's cool in its own way. 

(Note: This was build using a student account, which is why "f003kgm" is the main contributer.)
